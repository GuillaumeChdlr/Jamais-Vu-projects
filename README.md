# Jamais-Vu-projects
Jamais-Vu phenomenon experiments


There are 2 repertories with Python softwares, for pupil analysis (Tobii Pro Glasses 3 files) and cinematic movement analysis during writing

1 additional repertoire is dedicated to the induction of the unseen in a visual context.
  one sofware for E-Prime 3.0
  one open-source in psychopy
both softs has a same goal, induction with repetitive reading and timer for jamais-vu (read the comments, easy to understand)


All the programs are commented in french (I'll do in english next time or later, but I wasn't thinking about sharing them here at first so...) sorry :)
