# Jamais-Vu-projects
Jamais-Vu phenomenon experiments


There are 2 repertories : 

One with Python softwares, for pupil analysis (Tobii Pro Glasses 3 files) and cinematic movement analysis during writing

One additional repertoire is dedicated to the induction of the jamais-vu in a visual context.
  one sofware for E-Prime 3.0
  one open-source in psychopy
both softs has a same goal, induction with repetitive reading and timer for jamais-vu (read the comments, easy to understand)
